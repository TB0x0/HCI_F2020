# Sensation and Perception

*Sensation* - Stimulus that is detected by sensing abilities
*Perception* - Sensory input that has in some way been processed
*Cognition* - Includes basic perception, but also attention, memory, and applying historical knowledge.

## Perceptual Process

(a bottom up process)

1. Sense external stimuli
2. Processed by the brain
3. Perception is applied
4. Recognition
5. Action

**Absolute threshold of sensation:** Minimum amount of stimulation to register %50 of the time.

**Difference threshold:** At what point you can tell the difference between a level of brightness, weight, etc. (Weber's law)

## Why is Perception Important in HCI

Perception and reality are frequently different. It is how users connect to a system. Users act on what they perceive.

*Perception is more important than reality*

- Build for perception
- Perception is biased
