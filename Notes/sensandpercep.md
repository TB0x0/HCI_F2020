# Sensation and Perception

*Sensation* - Stimulus that is detected by sensing abilities
*Perception* - Sensory input that has in some way been processed
*Cognition* - Includes basic perception, but also attention, memory, and applying historical knowledge.

## Perceptual Process

(a bottom up process)

1. Sense external stimuli
2. Processed by the brain
3. Perception is applied
4. Recognition
5. Action

**Absolute threshold of sensation:** Minimum amount of stimulation to register %50 of the time.

**Difference threshold:** At what point you can tell the difference between a level of brightness, weight, etc. (Weber's law)

## Why is Perception Important in HCI

Perception and reality are frequently different. It is how users connect to a system. Users act on what they perceive.

*Perception is more important than reality*

- Build for perception
- Perception is biased

## How is Perception Studied

- Through pushing its limits and finding where it breaks. Like optical illusions.

- Through individuals with impairments and differences. Like patients with damage to specific portions of the brain or people who perceive differently.

- Through monitoring signals during perception. Brain imaging studies.


## Visual Perception Biases

- Exist at a low level
- Result of how our vision system has evolved (physiology and signal processing)
- Demonstrate gap between perception and reality.

*Example:*

In the photo below the red vertical lines are parallel even though they appear canted.

## Design Considerations

- Peripheral vision is strong. Put objects around the focus element.

- Color vision is limited. Avoid subtle color differences. Consider contrast, hue, and luminosity

- Create a clear visual hierarchy by organizing and prioritizing page contents.

## Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception

- Proximity - Items that are closer appear grouped  
- Similarity - Items are grouped according to similar characteristics (color, size)  
- Continuity - People tend to see continuous forms  
- Closure - People tend to see whole, closed objects and not fragments  
- Symmetry - People tend to see simple figures rather than complex ones  
- Figure/ground - People tend to separate foreground from background  
- Common fate - Things moving in the same direction are probably in the same group

## Fitts's Law

- The larger the target on screen and closer the starting point the faster you can point to it.

- Intuitive finding, but target size increases mean other increases are less influential.

## Time Perception

- Perceived responsiveness is more important than actual responsiveness

*Examples*

- Acknowledge input immediately
- Indicate how long an action will take
- Allow user to do other things while waiting
- Manage events intelligently
- Anticipate likely requests

## Haptics

- Involve sensing at skin, muscle, and bone
- Basic applications are mobile, wearable, and input devices
