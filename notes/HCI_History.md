## 1900 - 1945  

Batch processing and minimum human interaction. Machines were created to fulfill specialty roles.

**Human Factors**: concerned with optimizing assembly lines, safely designing planes, largely war-driven  
**Information Focus**: Maintaining and accessing information, also war-driven  

### Where HCI comes from  
- start in early 1900s, could go earlier  
- starts to involve psychology, cognitive demand  
- driven by world wars  
- information was the focus (cheaper printing, index cards, organizational methods like Dewey Decimal System)  


## 1945 - 1955  

**Managers**: specified the programs to be written and distributed the output

**Programmers**: worked with scientists to generate executable code for task

**Operators**: load by setting switches, positioning dials, and connecting cables

These occupations became a major focus of HCI research. It centered on Human Factors, (Management) Information Systems, and Computer Science.

- Goal of HCI during this time was to reduce operator burden.
- Libraries installed simple microfilm readers to assist with information retrieval as publication of scholarly and popular material soared, but interest in technology was otherwise limited.
- Better equipment, but still using vacuum tubes, extremely big, and required a crew to run them
- Focused on war-related tasks (hydrogen bomb simulations)
- ENIAC was created
- Computers not interactive (programmers and managers not interfacing directly)
- Batch processing
- The “engineering” efforts and the “library science” (or info science) somewhat split. The two groups collaborated, but library science headed off towards information theory.
- The idea for a microfilm-based “web” (called [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex)) was suggested in 1945 by Vannevar Bush-article “As We May Think” envisions hypertext-like system. It was theoretical and not implemented at the time.


## 1955 - 1965

Rapid Advancement as transistors came about.

- Focus on performance and error reduction
- Interest in ergonomics
- Transistor development, more stable, more widespread
- Programs loaded on cards
- Operators interacted directly with the system via a teletype (originally a printer, not a screen)
- Psychologists focused on errors during use, reducing errors, increasing performance
- Time-sharing allowed several simultaneous users (and later dozens) to work at terminals cabled to a single computer. Languages were developed to facilitate control and programming of time-sharing systems

*Aside*

Ted Nelson (1965) sociologists described “hyperlinking” system, considers modern wikis/blogs to be a realization of the concept. “Nelson wrote stirring calls for systems that would democratize computing through a highly interconnected, ex- tensible network of digital objects.”Ivan Sutherland and Computer Graphics. Sutherland’s 1963 Ph.D. thesis may be the most influential document in the history of HCI. His Sketchpad system, built on the TX-2 to make computers “more approachable,” launched computer graphics, which had a decisive impact on HCI twenty years later.

- HCI-like work was performed when computer resources in lower demand by others
 - ex: AI research hits road block, freeing up equipment more (back and forth dynamic)

**Demos are important**

- They have the power to show what is possible if effort is invested
- Inspire further ideas
- Measure progress

Some very important demos take place in this time period.

- Ivan Sutherland Sketchpad 1963: graphical display, pen input, CAD / diagramming domain focus
- Doug Englebart with Xerox: the mouse, copy and paste, word processing, video conferencing, collaborative doc editing, revision control, basic graphic windows and navigation menus


## 1965 - 1980

Prior to personal computing

The first university computer science departments formed in the mid-1960s, businesses embrace computers, AI is developed, and HCI groups emerge.

- Increased time-sharing (mainframes)
- Layered set of “users”
- Artificial intelligence, graphics, input devices, etc.
- Libraries incorporate computing as information science

In 1970 at Loughborough University, Brian Shackel founded the Human Sciences and Advanced Technology (HU- SAT) center, devoted to ergonomics research and emphasizing HCI

The Computer Systems Technical Group (CSTG) of the Human Factors Society was formed in 1972

In 1970, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) was created to develop new computer hardware, programming languages, and programming environments


## 1980 - 1985

Focus was on 'novice use.' The initial experience is significant to people who can choose whether or not to use a system, so it was important for vendors developing software for them.

GOMS was explicitly positioned to counter the stimulus-response bias of human factors research: CHI researchers and developers, wanting to identify with 'hard' science and engineering, adopted the terms 'cognitive engineering' and 'usability engineering.'

It would be years before CHI loosened its identification with engineering enough to welcome disciplines such as ethnography and design. Early CHI conferences had a few papers on speech and language, cognitive modeling, knowledge-based help, and knowledge elicitation, but AI was not a significant focus.

- More business use of smaller computers
- Xerox Star appears in 1981-first mainstream “desktop” computer. Used WIM(windows, icons, menus, pointers). It was not very successful.
- SIGCHI is created in 1982 as an Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) special interest group (SIG) focused on computer human interaction (CHI)
- Still the TOP annual international conference in the field CHI conference and is VERY large now with many sub-fields. It initially focused on engineering side, less social science approach, but that's not the case anymore

- Neural networks cause an AI Summer so interest and funding in HCI falls.

- 1984, Apple releases the Macintosh which incorporates WIMP and is much like the xerox star, but does much better in the market.

## 1985 - 1995

GUIs Win!
- GUIs initially controversial in CHI
- Windows 3.0 in 1990
- Computer Supported Cooperative Work  
- Participatory Design & Ethnography
- Library schools shifted to schools of Information

GUI success in late 1985 immediately transformed CHI. Only after Windows 3.0 succeeded in 1990 did GUIs influence the government agencies and business organizations that were the focus of HF&E and IS research. Computer Supported Cooperative Work Participatory design critiqued IS systems development approaches for non-discretionary users, yet it resonated with CHI researchers who had a commercial application focus on discretionary use.

Lucy Suchman managed a Xerox PARC group that presented studies of workplace activity at CSCW through the 1990s, several schools dropped 'Library' and became schools of Information. This is when widespread adoption of GUIs (and WIMP) happens. Several options are available: Apple, Microsoft, some others

- GUI success wins the interest of the HCI field
- Windows 3.0 in 1990 seals the deal for governments and many businesses
- Desktops (as we know them today) are spreading into homes
- Research starts to focus on multi-user experiences
- HCI / CHI begins to focus more on the users
- Methods now more frequently include thoroughly understanding users rather than just engineering more efficient mechanisms
- Less library science, they go back towards info science


## 1995 - Present

Rise of the Internet
- CHI pursues frontier
- Web content
- Widespread real-time communication
- From engineering to design
- From design to experience

As an application matured and use became routine, it got less attention. When email and word processing ceased being discretionary for most of us, CHI researchers moved to the discretionary use frontier of the moment: Web design, ubiquitous and mobile computing, social computing, Wikipedia use, and so on.The study of enjoyment was labeled “funology” lest someone think we were having too good a time (Blythe et al., 2003).

Now CHI lives on the frontier. If it is accepted and in broad use, it loses its appeal to many CHI researchers

- Always pushing the boundary, novelty is a very important part of CHI from here to present
- More computers are connected now! Real-time communication is possible for many people
- CHI focus moves beyond engineering (make it work) to usability (make it better to use)
- As we get closer to present day, field focuses more on “user experience” rather than just usability. User experience (UX) encompasses more of the user’s feelings, context, etc.
- We can make things that work, we can make things that are easy to use, so now focus more on facilitating a more broad experience
