# Cognition

## History and Study

Modern cognitive psychology emerged around 1956 founded on information processing and the computer model

**Behaviorism** preceded cognitive psychology and characterized everything by stimulus response mappings. It is good for simple things like habituation, but fails at more complex concepts.

## Methods of Cognitive Psychology

- Develop and test models that approximate the world
- Models should explain and predict
- Models must be testable
- *Parsimony:* Simpler theories are better

## Approaches and Tools

- Behavioral observation
- Cognitive impaired patient studies
- Cognitive neuroscience (fMRI, EEG, fNIRS)

## Attention

- How do people attend to stimuli (does not imply consciousness or awareness)
- Bottleneck theories gave way to capacity theories
- HCI needs to be aware of people's limited attention spans

**Major Characteristics**

- Focalization and concentration - Implies interest in selectivity (how we decide what stimuli is interesting)

## Memory Models

[Baddeley and Hitch 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory)

- Working Memory - finite area, can hold retrieved data or perceived data, contextual, sensory stimuli store (low level representations)

- Long-term Memory - high capacity, lasts a long time, retrieval is sometimes difficult.

  - Episodic - Memory about experiences
  - Procedural - Algorithms we remember for doing stuff (tying shoes)
  - Semantic - The meaning of perceptions and how they relate

*Recall Performance:* The best things we remember are the first (primacy) and the last (recency) things we interacted with.

## Dual Process Theory

[Relevant article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory)

Splits human thought into two systems. One side is quick and responsive, the other is slow and deliberate.

**System 1**
- Implicit
- Unconscious
- Automatic
- Involuntary (mostly)

**System 2**
- Explicit
- Conscious
- Controlled
- Voluntary

## Cognitive Bias

**Belief Bias** - Judgment based on prior belief rather than logic

**Confirmation Bias** - We prefer to confirm a hypothesis rather than disprove

**Representative Heuristic**
- A sample is representative if it looks like the population
  - Small sample fallacy: assuming a small sample will be representative of the population
  - Base rate fallacy: failing to consider base rates within the population

**Availability Heuristic**
