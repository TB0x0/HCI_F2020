## Design of Everyday Things

Addresses many topics including:

- Affordances - Represents the possible ways an agent can interact with something
- Signifiers - Signals that indicate what is to be acted upon or how to perform and action
- Conceptual/Mental Models - A person's understanding of how a system works
- Visibility - Functionality should be discoverable, reduces use of cognitive resources, confirms user's mental model
- Mapping - The link between an interface and action. *Goal:* minimize cognitive effort needed to transform action to outcome
- Feedback - Informs or confirms something has happened
- Metaphor - Describe something new in terms of something familiar, helpful for learning
- Consistency - Using similar elements throughout
- Constraints - Used to prevent errors
- Execution-evaluation Cycle - When people encounter a device they go through a cycle

*Seven Stages of Action:*
1. Form the goal
2. Plan the action
3. Specify an action sequence
4. Perform the action sequence
5. Perceive the new state
6. Interpret the perception
7. Compare outcome with goal

- Errors - Goal is to minimize and recover from errors (perceptual, cognitive, motor, etc.)
  - Sensibility checks
  - Make undo easy
  - Make destructive action hard
  - Discovery is easy, correction is easy
  - Don't treat actions as error
